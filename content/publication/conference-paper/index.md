summary: This paper comprehensively analyzes the heterogeneous effects of
  intermediate and final goods trade liberalization on firms’ managerial
  eﬀiciency. To account for the agency problem between owners and managers in a
  two-country general equilibrium model, we introduce a non-zero agency cost
  that prevents owners from perfectly monitoring managers’ behavior. The cost
  and terms-of-trade effects of intermediate goods liberalisation reinforce
  managers’ private incentives. In contrast, the impact of final goods
  liberalisation on managerial eﬀiciency depends on the relative strength of the
  beggar-thy-neighbor effect and the terms-of-trade effect. To empirically test
  our theoretical findings, we use firm-level data from China and construct
  valid indicators for managerial eﬀiciency. Our results confirm that
  liberalization of intermediate goods significantly reduces managerial
  eﬀiciency while liberalizing final goods enhances it. Moreover, we reveal how
  trade liberalisation affects managerial eﬀiciency through profits and prices.
  This study contributes theoretically and empirically to understanding
  managerial eﬀiciency decisions in an open economy. Our findings have important
  policy implications for corporate governance in trade liberalisation,
  improving firms’ managerial eﬀiciency and strengthening the foundation of
  microeconomic growth.
